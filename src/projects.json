I worked on the project in Hack the North 2020++ along with three other members. I was responsible for the script for rendering models using three.js and also created the backend using PHP. In the app, users can orbit, zoom in-and-out, move the 3d  model, as well as see the model in different variations. By providing  appropriate theories and explanations along with the descriptive 3D structures and animations, our aim is to ensure that students gain detailed knowledge."
